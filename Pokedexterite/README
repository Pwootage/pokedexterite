Pokedexterite Android App
========================

This is a in-progress android app that functions much like the Pokédex in
the Pokémon games. It eventually will be able to do all sorts of calculations
and other interesting things.

Special thanks to veekeun ( http://veekun.com/ ) for creating/releasing
his awesome database of everything you could possibly want to know about
Pokémon, the Pokédex here wouldn't be possible without it

Original Pokédex repository:

My modified Pokédex repository with Play Framework binding generation code:

Pokémon, as well as many of the resources included in this project, are 
intellectual property of Nintendo and GAME FREAK, and are believed to
fall under fair use.
